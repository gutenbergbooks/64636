<blockquote>
<p>[The following Tale was found among the papers of the late Diedrich
Knickerbocker, an old gentleman of New York, who was very curious in the
Dutch history of the province, and the manners of the descendants from
its primitive settlers. His historical researches, however, did not lie
so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span> among books as among men; for the former are lamentably scanty
on his favorite topics; whereas he found the old burghers, and still
more their wives, rich in that legendary lore so invaluable to true
history. Whenever, therefore, he happened upon a genuine Dutch family,
snugly shut up in its low-roofed farmhouse, under a spreading sycamore,
he looked upon it as a little clasped volume of black-letter, and
studied it with the zeal of a book-worm.</p>

<p>The result of all these researches was a history of the province during
the reign of the Dutch governors, which he published some years since.
There have been various opinions as to the literary character of his
work, and, to tell the truth, it is not a whit better than it should be.
Its chief merit is its scrupulous accuracy, which indeed was a little
questioned on its first appearance, but has since been completely
established; and it is now admitted into all historical collections as a
book of unquestionable authority.</p>

<p>The old gentleman died shortly after the publication of his work; and
now that he is dead and gone, it cannot do much harm to his memory to
say that his time might have been much better employed in weightier
labors. He, however, was apt to ride his hobby his own way; and though
it did now and then kick up the dust a little in the eyes of his
neighbors, and grieve the spirit of some friends, for whom he felt the
truest deference and affection, yet his errors and follies are
remembered “more in sorrow than in anger,” and it begins to be suspected
that he never intended to injure or offend. But however his memory may
be appreciated by critics, it is still held dear by many folk whose good
opinion is well worth having; particularly by certain biscuit-bakers,
who have gone so far as to imprint his likeness on their New-Year cakes;
and have thus given him a chance for immortality, almost equal to the
being stamped on a Waterloo Medal, or a Queen Anne’s Farthing.]</p>

<p class="noi"><span class="drop-cap">W</span>HOEVER has made a voyage up the Hudson must remember the Kaatskill
mountains. They are a dismembered branch of the great Appalachian
family, and are seen away to the west of the river, swelling up to a
noble height, and lording it over the surrounding country. Every change
of season, every change of weather, indeed, every hour of the day,
produces some change in the magical hues and shapes of these mountains,
and they are regarded by all the good wives, far and near, as perfect
barometers. When the weather is fair and settled, they are clothed in
blue and purple, and print their bold outlines on the clear evening sky;
but sometimes, when the rest of the landscape is cloudless, they will
gather a hood of gray vapors about their summits, which, in the last
rays of the setting sun, will glow and light up like a crown of glory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
At the foot of these fairy mountains, the voyager may have descried the
light smoke curling up from a village, whose shingle roofs gleam among
the trees, just where the blue tints of the upland melt away into the
fresh green of the nearer landscape. It is a little village of great
antiquity, having been founded by some of the Dutch colonists in the
early times of the province, just about the beginning of the government
of the good Peter Stuyvesant (may he rest in peace!) and there were some
of the houses of the original settlers standing within a few years,
built of small yellow bricks brought from Holland, having latticed
windows and gable fronts, surmounted with weathercocks.</p>

<div class="figcenter width250">
<img id="i014" src="images/i014.jpg" width="250" height="396" alt="“He was a descendant of the Van Winkles”" />
</div>

<p>In that same village, and in one of these very houses (which, to tell
the precise truth, was sadly time-worn and weather-beaten), there lived
many years since, while the country was yet a province of Great Britain,
a simple, good-natured fellow, of the name of Rip Van Winkle. He was a
descendant of the Van Winkles who figured so gallantly in the chivalrous
days of Peter Stuyvesant, and accompanied him to the siege of Fort
Christina. He inherited, however, but little of the martial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span> character of his ancestors. I have observed that he was a simple,
good-natured man; he was, moreover, a kind neighbor, and an obedient,
hen-pecked husband. Indeed, to the latter circumstance might be owing
that meekness of spirit which gained him such universal popularity; for
those men are most apt to be obsequious and conciliating abroad who are
under the discipline of shrews at home. Their tempers, doubtless, are
rendered pliant and malleable in the fiery furnace of domestic
tribulation, and a curtain-lecture is worth all the sermons in the world
for teaching the virtues of patience and long-suffering. A termagant
wife may, therefore, in some respects, be considered a tolerable
blessing; and if so, Rip Van Winkle was thrice blessed.</p>

<div class="figcenter width500">

<div class="figcenter width250">
<img id="i017" src="images/i017.jpg" width="250" height="443" alt="“A termagant wife”" />
</div>

<p>Certain it is, that he was a great favorite among all the good wives of
the village, who, as usual with the amiable sex, took his part in all
family squabbles, and never failed, whenever they talked those matters
over in their evening gossipings, to lay all the blame on Dame Van
Winkle. The children of the village, too, would shout with joy whenever
he approached. He assisted at their sports, made their playthings,
taught them to fly kites and shoot marbles, and told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span> them long stories
of ghosts, witches, and Indians. Whenever he went dodging about the
village, he was surrounded by a troop of them, hanging on his skirts,
clambering on his back, and playing a thousand tricks on him with
impunity; and not a dog would bark at him throughout the neighborhood.</p>

<div class="figcenter width400">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
The great error in Rip’s composition was an insuperable aversion to all
kinds of profitable labor. It could not be from the want of assiduity or
perseverance; for he would sit on a wet rock, with a rod as long and
heavy as a Tartar’s lance, and fish all day without a murmur, even
though he should not be encouraged by a single nibble. He would carry a
fowling-piece on his shoulder for hours together, trudging through woods
and swamps, and up hill and down dale, to shoot a few squirrels or wild
pigeons. He would never refuse to assist a neighbor even in the roughest
toil, and was a foremost man at all country frolics for husking Indian
corn, or building stone fences; the women of the village, too, used to
employ him to run their errands, and to do such little odd jobs as their
less obliging husbands would not do for them. In a word, Rip was ready
to attend to anybody’s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
business but his own; but as to
doing family duty, and keeping his farm in order, he found it
impossible.</p>

<div class="figcenter width500">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
<img id="i019" src="images/i019.jpg" width="500" height="618" alt="“Used to employ him to run their errands”" />
</div>

<p>In fact, he declared it was of no use to work on his farm; it was the
most pestilent little piece of ground in the whole country; everything
about it went wrong, and would go wrong in spite of him. His fences were
continually falling to pieces; his cow would either go astray, or get
among the cabbages; weeds were sure to grow quicker in his fields than
anywhere else; the rain always made a point of setting in just as he had
some out-door work to do; so that though his patrimonial estate had
dwindled away under his management, acre by acre, until there was little
more left than a mere patch of Indian corn and potatoes, yet it was the
worst conditioned farm in the neighborhood.</p>

<div class="figcenter width400">

</div>

<p>His children, too, were as ragged and wild as if they belonged to
nobody. His son Rip, an urchin begotten in his own likeness, promised to
inherit the habits, with the old clothes of his father. He was generally
seen trooping like a colt at his mother’s heels, equipped in a pair of
his father’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span> cast-off galligaskins, which he had much ado to hold up
with one hand, as a fine lady does her train in bad weather.</p>

<div class="figcenter width250">
<img id="i022a" src="images/i022a.jpg" width="250" height="362" alt="“Trooping like a colt at its mother’s heels”" />
</div>

<p>Rip Van Winkle, however, was one of those happy mortals, of foolish,
well-oiled dispositions, who take the world easy, eat white bread or
brown, whichever can be got with least thought or trouble, and would
rather starve on a penny than work for a pound. If left to himself, he
would have whistled life away, in perfect contentment; but his wife kept
continually dinning in his ears about his idleness, his carelessness,
and the ruin he was bringing on his family.</p>

<div class="figcenter width300">
<img id="i022b" src="images/i022b.jpg" width="300" height="312" alt="“His cow among the cabbages”" />
</div>

<p>Morning, noon, and night, her tongue was incessantly going, and
everything he said or did was sure to produce a torrent of household
eloquence. Rip had but one way of replying to all lectures of the kind,
and that, by frequent use, had grown into a habit. He shrugged his
shoulders, shook his head, cast up his eyes, but said nothing. This,
however, always provoked a fresh volley from his wife, so that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span> he was fain to draw off his forces, and take to the outside of
the house&mdash;the only side which, in truth, belongs to a hen-pecked
husband.</p>

<div class="figcenter width500">
<img id="i023" src="images/i023.jpg" width="500" height="659" alt="“How solemnly they would listen”" />
</div>

<p>Rip’s sole domestic adherent was his dog Wolf, who was as much henpecked
as his master; for Dame Van Winkle regarded them as companions in
idleness, and even looked upon Wolf with an evil eye, as the cause of
his master’s going so often astray. True it is, in all points of spirit
befitting an honorable dog, he was as courageous an animal as ever
scoured the woods&mdash;but what courage can withstand the ever-during and
all-besetting terrors of a woman’s tongue? The moment Wolf entered the
house, his crest fell, his tail drooped to the ground, or curled between
his legs, he sneaked about with a gallows air, casting many a sidelong
glance at Dame Van Winkle, and at the least flourish of a broomstick or
ladle, he would fly to the door with yelping precipitation.</p>

<div class="figcenter width250">
<img id="i025" src="images/i025.jpg" width="250" height="674" alt="“He shrugged his shoulders, shook his head, and cast up his eyes”" />
</div>

<p>Times grew worse and worse with Rip Van Winkle as years of matrimony
rolled on: a tart temper never mellows with age, and a sharp tongue is
the only edge tool that grows keener with constant use. For a long while
he used to console himself, when driven from home, by frequenting a kind
of perpetual club of the sages, philosophers, and other idle personages
of the village, which held its sessions on a bench before a small inn,
designated by a rubicund portrait of his majesty George the Third. Here
they used to sit in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span> shade of a long lazy summer’s day, talking
listlessly over village gossip, or telling endless sleepy stories about
nothing. But it would have been worth any statesman’s money to have
heard the profound discussions which sometimes took place, when by
chance an old newspaper fell into their hands, from some passing
traveller. How solemnly they would listen to the contents, as drawled
out by Derrick Van Bummel, the schoolmaster, a dapper learned little
man, who was not to be daunted by the most gigantic word in the
dictionary; and how sagely they would deliberate upon public events some
months after they had taken place.</p>

<div class="figcenter width400">
<img id="i026" src="images/i026.jpg" width="400" height="592" alt="“Yelping precipitation”" />
</div>

<p>The opinions of this junto were completely controlled by Nicholas
Vedder, a patriarch of the village, and landlord of the inn, at the door
of which he took his seat from morning till night, just moving
sufficiently to avoid the sun, and keep in the shade of a large tree; so
that the neighbors could tell the hour by his movements, as accurately
as by a sun-dial. It is true, he was rarely heard to speak, but smoked
his pipe incessantly. His adherents, however (for every great man has
his adherents), perfectly understood him, and knew how to gather his
opinions. When anything that was read <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span> or related
displeased him, he was observed to smoke his pipe vehemently, and to
send forth short, frequent, and angry puffs; but when pleased, he would
inhale the smoke slowly and tranquilly, and emit it in light and placid
clouds, and sometimes taking the pipe from his mouth, and letting the
fragrant vapor curl about his nose, would gravely nod his head in token
of perfect approbation.</p>

<div class="figcenter width500">
<img id="i027" src="images/i027.jpg" width="500" height="672" alt="“He would share the contents of his wallet”" />
</div>

<div class="figcenter width400">
<img id="i029" src="images/i029.jpg" width="400" height="454" alt="Nicholas Vedder" />
</div>

<p>From even this stronghold the unlucky Rip was at length routed by his
termagant wife, who would suddenly break in upon the tranquillity of the
assemblage, and call the members all to nought; nor was that august
personage, Nicholas Vedder himself, sacred from the daring tongue of
this terrible virago, who charged him outright with encouraging her
husband in habits of idleness.</p>

<p>Poor Rip was at last reduced almost to despair, and his only alternative
to escape from the labor of the farm and the clamor of his wife, was to
take gun in hand, and stroll away into the woods. Here he would
sometimes seat himself at the foot of a tree, and share the contents of
his wallet with Wolf, with whom he sympathized as a fellow-sufferer in
persecution. “Poor Wolf,” he would say, “thy mistress leads thee a dog’s
life of it; but never mind, my lad, whilst I live thou shalt never want
a friend to stand by thee!” Wolf would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span> wag his tail, look wistfully in
his master’s face, and if dogs can feel pity, I verily believe he
reciprocated the sentiment with all his heart.</p>

<p>In a long ramble of the kind, on a fine autumnal day, Rip had
unconsciously scrambled to one of the highest parts of the Kaatskill
mountains. He was after his favorite sport of squirrel-shooting, and the
still solitudes had echoed and re-echoed with the reports of his gun.
Panting and fatigued, he threw himself, late in the afternoon, on a
green knoll covered with mountain herbage, that crowned the brow of a
precipice. From an opening between the trees, he could overlook all the
lower country for many a mile of rich woodland. He saw at a distance the
lordly Hudson, far, far below him, moving on its silent but majestic
course, with the reflection of a purple cloud, or the sail of a lagging
bark, here and there sleeping on its glassy bosom, and at last losing
itself in the blue highlands.</p>

<p>On the other side he looked down into a deep mountain glen, wild,
lonely, and shagged, the bottom filled with fragments from the impending
cliffs, and scarcely lighted by the reflected rays of the setting sun.
For some time Rip lay musing on this scene; evening was gradually
advancing; the mountains began to throw their long blue shadows over the
valleys; he saw that it would be dark long before he could reach the
village; and he heaved a heavy sigh when he thought of encountering the
terrors of Dame Van Winkle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
As he was about to descend he heard a voice from a distance hallooing,
“Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!” He looked around, but could see
nothing but a crow winging its solitary flight across the mountain. He
thought his fancy <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
 must have deceived him, and turned
again to descend, when he heard the same cry ring through the still
evening air, “Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!”&mdash;at the same time Wolf
bristled up his back, and giving a low growl, skulked to his master’s
side, looking fearfully down into the glen. Rip now felt a vague
apprehension stealing over him; he looked anxiously in the same
direction, and perceived a strange figure slowly toiling up the rocks,
and bending under the weight of something he carried on his back. He was
surprised to see any human being in this lonely and unfrequented place,
but supposing it to be some one of the neighborhood in need of his
assistance, he hastened down to yield it.</p>

<div class="figcenter width500">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
<img id="i031" src="images/i031.jpg" width="500" height="577" alt="“The brow of a precipice”" />
</div>

<p>On nearer approach, he was still more surprised at the singularity of
the stranger’s appearance. He was a short, square-built old fellow, with
thick bushy hair, and a grizzled beard. His dress was of the antique
Dutch fashion&mdash;a cloth jerkin strapped round the waist&mdash;several pair of
breeches, the outer one of ample volume, decorated with rows of buttons
down the sides, and bunches at the knees. He bore on his shoulders a
stout keg, that seemed full of liquor, and made signs for Rip to
approach and assist him with the load. Though rather shy and distrustful
of this new acquaintance, Rip complied with his usual alacrity, and
mutually relieving each other, they clambered up a narrow gully,
apparently the dry bed of a mountain torrent. As they ascended, Rip
every now and then heard long rolling peals, like distant thunder, that
seemed to issue out of a deep ravine, or rather cleft between lofty
rocks, toward which their rugged path conducted. He paused for an
instant, but supposing it to be the muttering of one of those transient
thunder-showers which often take place in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span> mountain heights, he
proceeded. Passing through the ravine, they came to a hollow, like a
small amphitheatre, surrounded by perpendicular precipices, over the
brinks of which, impending trees shot their branches, so that you only
caught glimpses of the azure sky and the bright evening cloud. During
the whole time, Rip and his companion had labored on in silence; for
though the former marvelled greatly what could be the object of carrying
a keg of liquor up this wild mountain, yet there was something strange
and incomprehensible about the unknown, that inspired awe, and checked
familiarity.</p>

<div class="figcenter width400">
<img id="i034" src="images/i034.jpg" width="400" height="571" alt="“He heard a voice”" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
On entering the amphitheatre, new objects of wonder presented
themselves. On a level spot in the centre was a company of odd-looking
personages playing at nine-pins. They were dressed in a quaint
outlandish fashion: some wore short doublets, others jerkins, with long
knives in their belts, and most of them had enormous breeches, of
similar style with that of the guide’s. Their visages too, were
peculiar: one had a large head, broad face, and small piggish eyes; the
face of another seemed to consist entirely of nose, and was surmounted
by a white sugar-loaf hat, set off with a little red cock’s tail. They
all had beards, of various shapes and colors. There was one who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
seemed to be the commander. He was a stout old
gentleman, with a weather-beaten countenance; he wore a laced doublet,
broad belt and hanger, high-crowned hat and feather, red stockings, and
high-heeled shoes, with roses in them. The whole group reminded Rip of
the figures in an old Flemish painting, in the parlor of Domine Van
Schaick, the village parson, and which had been brought over from
Holland at the time of the settlement.</p>

<div class="figcenter width500">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
<img id="i035" src="images/i035.jpg" width="500" height="654" alt="“A strange figure”" />
</div>

<div class="figcenter width500">
<img id="i037" src="images/i037.jpg" width="500" height="673" alt="“Rip and his companion labored on in silence”" />
</div>

<div class="figcenter width400">
<img id="i039" src="images/i039.jpg" width="400" height="596" alt="“A company of odd-looking personages”" />
</div>

<p>What seemed particularly odd to Rip was, that though these folks were
evidently amusing themselves, yet they maintained the gravest faces, the
most mysterious silence, and were, withal, the most melancholy party of
pleasure he had ever witnessed. Nothing interrupted the stillness of the
scene but the noise of the balls, which, whenever they were rolled,
echoed along the mountains like rumbling peals of thunder.</p>

<p>As Rip and his companion approached them, they suddenly desisted from
their play, and stared at him with such a fixed statue-like gaze, and
such strange, uncouth, lack-lustre countenances, that his heart turned
within him, and his knees smote together. His companion now emptied the
contents of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span> keg into large flagons, and made signs to him to wait
upon the company. He obeyed with fear and trembling; they quaffed the
liquor in profound silence, and then returned to their game.</p>

<p>By degrees, Rip’s awe and apprehension subsided. He even ventured, when
no eye was fixed upon him, to taste the beverage, which he found had
much of the flavor of excellent Hollands. He was naturally a thirsty
soul, and was soon tempted to repeat the draught. One taste provoked
another, and he reiterated his visits to the flagon so often, that at
length his senses were overpowered, his eyes swam in his head, his head
gradually declined, and he fell into a deep sleep.</p>

<div class="figcenter width400">
<img id="i040" src="images/i040.jpg" width="400" height="489" alt="“One who seemed to be the commander”" />
</div>

<p>On waking, he found himself on the green knoll from whence he had first
seen the old man of the glen. He rubbed <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span> his eyes&mdash;it was
a bright sunny morning. The birds were hopping and twittering among the
bushes, and the eagle was wheeling aloft, and breasting the pure
mountain breeze. “Surely,” thought Rip, “I have not slept here all
night.” He recalled the occurrences before he fell asleep. The strange
man with the keg of liquor&mdash;the mountain ravine&mdash;the wild retreat among
the rocks&mdash;the woe-begone party at nine-pins&mdash;the flagon&mdash;“Oh! that
wicked flagon!” thought Rip&mdash;“what excuse shall I make to Dame Van
Winkle?”</p>

<div class="figcenter width500">
<img id="i041" src="images/i041.jpg" width="500" height="658" alt="“They quaffed the liquor in profound silence”" />
</div>

<div class="figcenter width400">
<img id="i043" src="images/i043.jpg" width="400" height="359" alt="“I have not slept here all night”" />
</div>

<p>He looked round for his gun, but in place of the clean well-oiled
fowling-piece, he found an old firelock lying by him, the barrel
encrusted with rust, the lock falling off, and the stock worm-eaten. He
now suspected that the grave roysters of the mountain had put a trick
upon him, and having dosed him with liquor, had robbed him of his gun.
Wolf, too, had disappeared, but he might have strayed away after a
squirrel or partridge. He whistled after him and shouted his name, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
all in vain; the echoes repeated his whistle and shout, but no dog was
to be seen.</p>

<p>He determined to revisit the scene of the last evening’s gambol, and if
he met with any of the party, to demand his dog and gun. As he rose to
walk, he found himself stiff in the joints, and wanting in his usual
activity. “These mountain beds do not agree with me,” thought Rip, “and
if this frolic should lay me up with a fit of the rheumatism, I shall
have a blessed time with Dame Van Winkle.” With some difficulty he got
down into the glen; he found the gully up which he and his companion had
ascended the preceding evening; but to his astonishment a mountain
stream was now foaming down it, leaping from rock to rock, and filling
the glen with babbling murmurs. He, however, made shift to scramble up
its sides, working his toilsome way through thickets of birch,
sassafras, and witch-hazel; and sometimes tripped up or entangled by the
wild grape vines that twisted their coils and tendrils from tree to
tree, and spread a kind of network in his path.</p>

<div class="figcenter width400">
<img id="i044" src="images/i044.jpg" width="400" height="596" alt="“Wanting in his usual activity”" />
</div>

<p>At length he reached to where the ravine had opened through the cliffs
to the amphitheatre; but no traces of such opening remained. The rocks
presented a high impenetrable wall, over which the torrent came tumbling
in a sheet of feathery <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
foam, and fell into a broad deep
basin, black from the shadows of the surrounding forest. Here, then,
poor Rip was brought to a stand. He again called and whistled after his
dog; he was only answered by the cawing of a flock of idle crows,
sporting high in the air about a dry tree that overhung a sunny
precipice; and who, secure in their elevation, seemed to look down and
scoff at the poor man’s perplexities. What was to be done? The morning
was passing away, and Rip felt famished for want of his breakfast. He
grieved to give up his dog and gun; he dreaded to meet his wife; but it
would not do to starve among the mountains. He shook his head,
shouldered the rusty firelock, and, with a heart full of trouble and
anxiety, turned his steps homeward.</p>

<div class="figcenter width500">
<img id="i045" src="images/i045.jpg" width="500" height="664" alt="“He called again and whistled after his dog”" />
</div>

<div class="figcenter width500">
<img id="i047" src="images/i047.jpg" width="500" height="236" alt="“Stroked their chins”" />
</div>

<p>As he approached the village, he met a number of people, but none whom
he knew, which somewhat surprised him, for he had thought himself
acquainted with every one in the country round. Their dress, too, was of
a different fashion from that to which he was accustomed. They all
stared at him with equal marks of surprise, and whenever they cast eyes
upon him, invariably stroked their chins. The constant recurrence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span> of
this gesture induced Rip, involuntarily, to do the same, when, to his
astonishment, he found his beard had grown a foot long!</p>

<p>He had now entered the skirts of the village. A troop of strange
children ran at his heels, hooting after him, and pointing at his gray
beard. The dogs, too, not one of which he recognized for an old
acquaintance, barked at him as he passed. The very village was altered:
it was larger and more populous. There were rows of houses which he had
never seen before, and those which had been his familiar haunts had
disappeared. Strange names were over the doors&mdash;strange faces at the
windows&mdash;everything was strange. His mind now misgave him; he began to
doubt whether both he and the world around him were not bewitched.
Surely this was his native village, which he had left but a day before.
There stood the Kaatskill mountains&mdash;there ran the silver Hudson at a
distance&mdash;there was every hill and dale precisely as it had always
been&mdash;Rip was sorely perplexed&mdash;“That flagon last night,” thought he,
“has addled my poor head sadly!”</p>

<p>It was with some difficulty that he found the way to his own house,
which he approached with silent awe, expecting every moment to hear the
shrill voice of Dame Van Winkle. He found the house gone to decay&mdash;the
roof fallen in, the windows shattered, and the doors off the hinges. A
half-starved dog, that looked like Wolf, was skulking about it. Rip
called him by name, but the cur snarled, showed his teeth, and passed
on. This was an unkind cut indeed.&mdash;“My very dog,” sighed poor Rip, “has
forgotten me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
He entered the house, which, to tell the truth, Dame Van Winkle had
always kept in neat order. It was empty, forlorn, and
apparently abandoned. This desolateness overcame all
his connubial fears&mdash;he called loudly for his wife and children&mdash;the
lonely chambers rang for a moment with his voice, and then all again was
silence.</p>

<div class="figcenter width500">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
<img id="i049" src="images/i049.jpg" width="500" height="706" alt="“A troop of strange children ran at his heels”" />

<div class="figcenter width400">
<img id="i053" src="images/i053.jpg" width="400" height="622" alt="“He recognized on the sign”" />
</div>

<p>He now hurried forth, and hastened to his old resort, the village
inn&mdash;but it too was gone. A large rickety wooden building stood in its
place, with great gaping windows, some of them broken, and mended with
old hats and petticoats, and over the door was painted, “The Union
Hotel, by Jonathan Doolittle.” Instead of the great tree that used to
shelter the quiet little Dutch inn of yore, there now was reared a tall
naked pole, with something on the top that looked like a red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span> night-cap,
and from it was fluttering a flag, on which was a singular assemblage of
stars and stripes&mdash;all this was strange and incomprehensible. He
recognized on the sign, however, the ruby face of King George, under
which he had smoked so many a peaceful pipe, but even this was
singularly metamorphosed. The red coat was changed for one of blue and
buff, a sword was held in the hand instead of a sceptre, the head was
decorated with a cocked hat, and underneath was painted in large
characters, <span class="smcap">General Washington</span>.</p>

<div class="figcenter width500">
<img id="i055" src="images/i055.jpg" width="500" height="721" alt="“They crowded round him”" />
</div>

<p>There was, as usual, a crowd of folk about the door, but none that Rip
recollected. The very character of the people seemed changed. There was
a busy, bustling, disputatious tone about it,
<a name="instead" id="instead"></a><ins title="Original has 'intead'">instead</ins>
of the accustomed phlegm and drowsy tranquillity. He looked in vain for the
sage Nicholas Vedder, with his broad face, double chin, and fair long
pipe, uttering clouds of tobacco smoke, instead of idle speeches; or Van
Bummel, the schoolmaster, doling forth the contents of an ancient
newspaper. In place of these, a lean bilious-looking fellow, with his
pockets full of handbills, was haranguing vehemently about rights of
citizens&mdash;election&mdash;members of Congress&mdash;liberty&mdash;Bunker’s hill&mdash;heroes
of seventy-six&mdash;and other words, that were a perfect Babylonish jargon
to the bewildered Van Winkle.</p>

<div class="figcenter width500">
<img id="i057" src="images/i057.jpg" width="500" height="629" alt="“A lean, bilious-looking fellow”" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
The appearance of Rip, with his long, grizzled beard, his rusty
fowling-piece, his uncouth dress, and the army of women and children
that had gathered at his heels, soon attracted the attention of the
tavern politicians. They crowded round him, eyeing him from head to
foot, with great curiosity. The orator bustled up to him, and drawing
him partly aside, inquired, “on which side he voted?” Rip stared in
vacant stupidity. Another short but busy
little fellow pulled him by the arm, and rising on tiptoe, inquired in
his ear, “whether he was Federal or Democrat.” Rip was equally at a loss
to comprehend the question; when a knowing, self-important old
gentleman, in a sharp cocked hat, made his way through the crowd,
putting them to the right and left with his elbows as he passed, and
planting himself before Van Winkle, with one arm a-kimbo, the other
resting on his cane, his keen eyes and sharp hat penetrating, as it
were, into his very soul, demanded in an austere tone, “what brought him
to the election with a gun on his shoulder, and a mob at his heels, and
whether he meant to breed a riot in the village?”</p>

“Alas! gentlemen,” cried Rip, somewhat dismayed, “I am a poor, quiet
man, a native of the place, and a loyal subject of the King, God bless
him!”</p>

<p>Here a general shout burst from the bystanders&mdash;“a tory! a tory! a spy!
a refugee! hustle him! away with him!”</p>

<p>It was with great difficulty that the self-important man in the cocked
hat restored order; and having assumed a tenfold austerity of brow,
demanded again of the unknown culprit, what he came there for, and whom
he was seeking. The poor man humbly assured him that he meant no harm,
but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span> merely came there in search of some of his neighbors, who used to
keep about the tavern.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;who are they?&mdash;name them.”</p>

<p>Rip bethought himself a moment, and inquired, “Where’s Nicholas Vedder?”</p>

<div class="figcenter width400">
<img id="i060" src="images/i060.jpg" width="400" height="468" alt="“A great militia-general”" />
</div>

<p>There was a silence for a little while, when an old man replied, in a
thin, piping voice, “Nicholas Vedder? why, he is dead and gone these
eighteen years! There was a wooden tomb-stone in the church-yard that
used to tell all about him, but that’s rotten and gone too.”</p>

<p>“Where’s Brom Dutcher?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he went off to the army in the beginning of the war; some say he
was killed at the storming of Stony-Point&mdash;others say he was drowned in
the squall, at the foot of Antony’s Nose. I don’t know&mdash;he never came
back again.”</p>

<p>“Where’s Van Bummel, the schoolmaster?”</p>

<p>“He went off to the wars, too; was a great militia general, and is now
in Congress.”</p>

<p>Rip’s heart died away, at hearing of these sad changes in his home and
friends, and finding himself thus alone in the world. Every answer
puzzled him, too, by treating of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span> enormous lapses of time, and of
matters which he could not understand: war&mdash;Congress&mdash;Stony-Point!&mdash;he
had no courage to ask after any more friends, but cried out in despair,
“Does nobody here know Rip Van Winkle?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Rip Van Winkle!” exclaimed two or three. “Oh, to be sure! that’s
Rip Van Winkle yonder, leaning against the tree.”</p>

<p>Rip looked, and beheld a precise counterpart of himself as he went up
the mountain; apparently as lazy, and certainly as ragged. The poor
fellow was now completely confounded. He doubted his own identity, and
whether he was himself or another man. In the midst of his bewilderment,
the man in the cocked hat demanded who he was, and what was his name?</p>

<div class="figcenter width250">
<img id="i061" src="images/i061.jpg" width="250" height="470" alt="“That is Rip Van Winkle, yonder”" />
</div>

<p>“God knows,” exclaimed he at his wit’s end; “I’m not myself&mdash;I’m
somebody else&mdash;that’s me yonder&mdash;no&mdash;that’s somebody else, got into my
shoes&mdash;I was myself last night, but I fell asleep on the mountain, and
they’ve changed my gun, and everything’s changed, and I’m changed, and I
can’t tell what’s my name, or who I am!”</p>

<p>The by-standers began now to look at each other, nod, wink
significantly, and tap their fingers against their foreheads.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span> There was
a whisper, also, about securing the gun, and keeping the old fellow from
doing mischief; at the very suggestion of which, the self-important man
with the cocked hat retired with some precipitation. At this critical
moment a fresh comely woman passed through the throng to get a peep at
the gray-bearded man. She had a chubby child in her arms, which,
frightened at his looks, began to cry. “Hush, Rip,” cried she, “hush,
you little fool; the old man won’t hurt you.” The name of the child, the
air of the mother, the tone of her voice, all awakened a train of
recollections in his mind.</p>

<div class="figcenter width250">
<img id="i062" src="images/i062.jpg" width="250" height="418" alt="“A fresh, comely woman”" />
</div>

<p>“What is your name, my good woman?” asked he.</p>

<p>“Judith Gardenier.”</p>

<p>“And your father’s name?”</p>

<p>“Ah, poor man, his name was Rip Van Winkle; it’s twenty years since he
went away from home with his gun, and never has been heard of since&mdash;his
dog came home without him; but whether he shot himself, or was carried
away by the Indians, nobody can tell. I was then but a little girl.”</p>

<p>Rip had but one question more to ask; but he put it with a faltering
voice:</p>

<p>“Where’s your mother?”</p>

<div class="figcenter width500">
<img id="i063" src="images/i063.jpg" width="500" height="654" alt="“What is your name, my good woman?”" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
Oh, she too had died but a short time since: she broke a blood-vessel in
a fit of passion at a New-England pedler.</p>

<p>There was a drop of comfort, at least, in this intelligence. The honest
man could contain himself no longer. He caught his daughter and her
child in his arms. “I am your father!” cried he&mdash;“Young Rip Van Winkle
once&mdash;old Rip Van Winkle now&mdash;Does nobody know poor Rip Van Winkle!”</p>

<p>All stood amazed, until an old woman, tottering out from among the
crowd, put her hand to her brow, and peering under it in his face for a
moment, exclaimed, “Sure enough! it is Rip Van Winkle&mdash;it is himself.
Welcome home again, old neighbor&mdash;Why, where have you been these twenty
long years?”</p>

<div class="figcenter width250">
<img id="i065" src="images/i065.jpg" width="250" height="354" alt="Peter Vanderdonk" />
</div>

<p>Rip’s story was soon told, for the whole twenty years had been to him
but as one night. The neighbors stared when they heard it; some were
seen to wink at each other, and put their tongues in their cheeks; and
the self-important man in the cocked hat, who, when the alarm was over,
had returned to the field, screwed down the corners of his mouth, and
shook his head&mdash;upon which there was a general shaking of the head
throughout the assemblage.</p>

<div class="figcenter width500">
<img id="i066" src="images/i066.jpg" width="500" height="386" alt="“Friends among the rising generation”" />
</div>

<p>It was determined, however, to take the opinion of old Peter Vanderdonk,
who was seen slowly advancing up the road. He was a descendant of the
historian of that name, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span> wrote one of the earliest accounts of the
province. Peter was the most ancient inhabitant of the village, and well
versed in all the wonderful events and traditions of the neighborhood.
He recollected Rip at once, and corroborated his story in the most
satisfactory manner. He assured the company that it was a fact, handed
down from his ancestor the historian, that the Kaatskill mountains had
always been haunted by strange beings. That it was affirmed that the
great Hendrick Hudson, the first discoverer of the river and country,
kept a kind of vigil there every twenty years, with his crew of the
Halfmoon, being permitted in this way to revisit the scenes of his
enterprise, and keep a guardian eye upon the river and the great city
called by his name. That his father had once seen them in their old
Dutch dresses playing at nine-pins in the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span> hollow of the
mountain; and that he himself had heard, one summer afternoon, the sound
of their balls, like distant peals of thunder.</p>

<div class="figcenter width500">
<img id="i067" src="images/i067.jpg" width="500" height="638" alt="“Once more on the bench at the inn door”" />
</div>

<p>To make a long story short, the company broke up, and returned to the
more important concerns of the election. Rip’s daughter took him home to
live with her; she had a snug, well-furnished house, and a stout cheery
farmer for a husband, whom Rip recollected for one of the urchins that
used to climb upon his back. As to Rip’s son and heir, who was the ditto
of himself, seen leaning against the tree, he was employed to work on
the farm; but evinced a hereditary disposition to attend to anything
else but his business.</p>

<p>Rip now resumed his old walks and habits; he soon found many of his
former cronies, though all rather the worse for the wear and tear of
time; and preferred making friends among the rising generation, with
whom he soon grew into great favor.</p>

<p>Having nothing to do at home, and being arrived at that happy age when a
man can do nothing with impunity, he took his place once more on the
bench, at the inn door, and was reverenced as one of the patriarchs of
the village, and a chronicle of the old times “before the war.” It was
some time before he could get into the regular track of gossip, or could
be made to comprehend the strange events that had taken place during his
torpor. How that there had been a revolutionary war&mdash;that the country
had thrown off the yoke of old England&mdash;and that, instead of being a
subject of his majesty George the Third, he was now a free citizen of
the United States. Rip, in fact, was no politician; the changes of
states and empires made but little impression on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span> him; but there was one
species of despotism under which he had long groaned, and that
was&mdash;petticoat government. Happily, that was at an end; he had got his
neck out of the yoke of matrimony, and could go in and out whenever he
pleased, without dreading the tyranny of Dame Van Winkle. Whenever her
name was mentioned, however, he shook his head, shrugged his shoulders,
and cast up his eyes; which might pass either for an expression of
resignation to his fate, or joy at his deliverance.</p>

<div class="figcenter width500">
<img id="i070" src="images/i070.jpg" width="500" height="332" alt="“He used to tell his story to every stranger”" />
</div>

<p>He used to tell his story to every stranger that arrived at Mr.
Doolittle’s hotel. He was observed, at first, to vary on some points
every time he told it, which was doubtless owing to his having so
recently awaked. It at last settled down precisely to the tale I have
related, and not a man, woman, or child in the neighborhood, but knew it
by heart. Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span> always pretended to doubt the reality of it, and
insisted that Rip had been out of his head, and that this was one point
on which he always remained flighty. The old Dutch inhabitants, however,
almost universally gave it full credit. Even to this day, they never
hear a thunder-storm of a summer afternoon about the Kaatskill, but they
say Hendrick Hudson and his crew are at their game of nine-pins; and it
is a common wish of all henpecked husbands in the neighborhood, when
life hangs heavy on their hands, that they might have a quieting draught
out of Rip Van Winkle’s flagon.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The foregoing tale, one would suspect, had been suggested
to Mr. Knickerbocker by a little German superstition about the
Emperor Frederick <i>der Rothbart</i> and the Kypphauser mountain;
the subjoined note, however, which he had appended to the tale,
shows that it is an absolute fact, narrated with his usual
fidelity.</p>

<p>“The story of Rip Van Winkle may seem incredible to many, but
nevertheless I give it my full belief, for I know the vicinity
of our old Dutch settlements to have been very subject to
marvellous events and appearances. Indeed, I have heard many
stranger stories than this, in the villages along the Hudson;
all of which were too well authenticated to admit of a doubt. I
have even talked with Rip Van Winkle myself, who, when last I
saw him, was a very venerable old man, and so perfectly rational
and consistent on every other point, that I think no
conscientious person could refuse to take this into the bargain;
nay, I have seen a certificate on the subject taken before a
country justice, and signed with a cross, in the justice’s own
handwriting. The story, therefore, is beyond the possibility of
doubt.”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
